This day felt quite strange and very final. Many items had been brought from North Dakota when my grandparents had followed their five children out west to Oregon. Everything held meaning for us. The pots and pans inspired memories of homemade food cooked with much effort and in the \"German way.\" Linens and bedding told of the many nights dedicated to stitching embroidery patterns by hand to reassure a good nightís dreams. My Grandpaís accordian saw us dancing the Polka, Two Step and Waltz for hours until we were all giggly, sweaty and tuckered out. Things were worn and torn and kept because they were still useful and \"came from the farm.\" It was no wonder my Grandmother insisted we make all our gifts and cards because \"they will last,\" she would say. I now think she meant that homemade is heartfelt and nothing can last longer than the love that accompanies such an item. \r\nWe sat around and talked that day about how we traveled in the motor home back to North Dakota every summer to hop farms and visit all of our german relatives. We remembered feeling very welcome and celebrated there. There was also the 1/2 acre garden we kept out back where a midday snack of sweet cherry tomatoes or crisp green beans could always be found. And, we laughed about how everyone\'s least favorite job was peeling garlic around the kitchen table so our Grandmother and Great German Aunties could can pickles and tomato sauces for the winter to come. And the barn....who could forget the beautiful, white barn with all its hideaways and the loft where many a secret and dreams were shared between sisters. I grew up learning the ways of the land and farm without ever knowing it. I realized then that my farmgirl story was just beginning, as my grandmotherís was about to fade... \r\nI now live with my husband and two beautiful children in Portland, Oregon. I grew up here and hold it dear...especially, after traveling far and wide \"to find what I was looking for.\" The forty acres that I roam is magical...with many trees towering sky high, and a view of Mt. Adams, Mt. St. Helens, and Mt. Rainier that sees the sunrise start our every day. There is an ongoing plan to create a place where we grow enough food to can, store and CSA to family and friends. Our garden is getting bigger every year! And now that we can call ourselves comfortable with chickens, there is an exciting future for some lucky goats and a llama, come summertime. I have found my home with all these wonderful gifts, which I finally realized never resided in any particular place, but rather is a frame of mind. I have learned to bloom where I am planted, and intend on staying here awhile. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading my farmgirl story.\r\n\r\n', '', '', '', '', 'Art', 'Drawing illustrations', 'Clothing,boots,vintage', 'original, oil paintings, boots,vintage,colorful', null, '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', null, null, null, null, null, null, '2012-08-31 17:05:38', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', null, '', '', '', '', '', 'bootsy', '', null, '1'), ('479', '32', 'Big Mountains', 'Rex', 'Long', 'rex@farmmade.com', 'longpatti@yahoo.com', '', '', 'Portland', 'Oregon', '', 'United States', '0', '0', 'Big Mountains sells western vintage boots and native american sterling silver jewelry', 'Once upon a time my wife wanted me to build a small barn. I thought...Well, I have already built a shop, dog house, chicken coop, roadside stand and our farm sign, I guess I could.  But she could tell that I wasnít enthusiastic about it.  \"This barn would house our goats,\" she urged, knowing full well my weakness for goat cheese.  It didnít take me long to agree, and as I pounded the last few nails into the boards, my parentsí stories about growing up in rural Tennessee and West Virginia suddenly became quite relevant and not buried in the distant past. I started to feel a proud connection to my heritage, and it got me thinking about the way I grew up.\r\nFor as long as I can remember my father was always exposing me to the insights of invention. When he was growing up on the farm, there were no Home Depots just around the corner. Skills was learned and performed correctly in order for production to exist. If you broke something, you had to fix it. My dad taught me to be self-sufficient and to do a job once, which means \"doing it right the first timeî. His early guidance led to a certain quality and efficiency I now put into everything I create.\r\nEating good food was important to me as a kid. Early on, I learned to appreciate the effort that went into making a great dinner and realized that to cook \"Southern style\" required a lot more than just a can opener and a fork. My mother\'s best dishes were made from scratch, and from a knowledge passed down from her own mother and grandmother. She let me learn by her side and take liberties to experiment with all sorts of ingredients. It was a ton of fun! I gather it was both her sweet Southern charm and our smooth ceramic stove top that allowed such a big mess to be made--and very little heck to be paid!\r\nSo, it seems to me this newfound lifestyle of ours is not only grounded in rich tradition but has a deeper meaning and purpose than I ever thought in the beginning. I intend to continue passing on all of these riches to my own two children and hope they realize its importance, also. When I look at the barn I built with my own two hands I realize somewhere inside of everyone there is a similar story, for all of us have come from \"the farm\" at one point or another and are indebted to those who came before us.\r\nThank you for reading my heartfelt Farmboy story!\r\n', 'Lmj', '', '', '', 'Jewelry', '', 'Vintage,Boots', 'Sterling Silver,Leather Goods', null, '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', null, null, null, null, null, null, '2012-09-03 22:54:41', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', null, '', '', '', '', '', 'bigmountains', '<p>this is rex&#39;s shop message.</p>\r\n', null, '1'), ('481', '37', '1840 Farm', 'Jennifer', 'Burcke', 'shop@1840farm.com', '1840farm@myfairpoint.net', '127 Littleworth Road', '', 'Dover', 'New Hampshire', '03820', 'United States', '0', '0', 'Welcome to 1840 Farm on FarmMade.com.

I wasnít raised to be a farmer and I would have never imagined that I would feel the gravitational pull to live a country cottage farming lifestyle. Yet here I am, living on a farm with my parents, husband, and two children. Today, it is hard for me to imagine living any other way.\r\n\r\n I was inspired to become a farmer by my family past and present. The memory of my grandparents and great grandparents inspired me to dare to attempt to become a farmer. The daily encouragement and support of my husband, children, and parents motivates me to continue to improve my skills and develop my craft. My goal is to raise food for our table while raising two children who will always hold their food supply firmly within their grasp.\r\n\r\nAt 1840 Farm, we offer our farm products for sale locally.  We sell cottage perennials from our vast gardens as well as heirloom tomato seedlings. Last year, we sold our first two Nigerian Dwarf goat kids. Through the Internet, we sell our handmade fabric coiled baskets, hand painted wooden signs, and repurposed fabric items. We hope to expand our offerings this fall to offer more handmade items including a line of products for farm kids just like mine. We also plan to offer the first 1840 Farm Heirloom Seed Collection for purchase early next year.\r\n\r\nWe began to offer our products for sale in 2011 in order to help support our farm financially. We never imagined that doing so would also support our family on a much deeper level. When our customers tell us how much they love our products and look forward to reading about our farm, it reminds us that our journey is not limited to those of us physically living here at 1840 Farm. Instead, it is made richer by inviting all of them to take part in our daily adventures no matter where they might call home. Interacting with the members of the 1840 Farm Community online on a daily basis only reinforces that belief.

I guess Iíve always been a farm girl at heart. Discovering the magazine MaryJanesFarm a few years back confirmed it! Life takes its twists and turns and Iíve yet to make it to that little farm of my dreams so instead (like so many other suburban, urban, and city farmers) today Iíve created one in my backyard in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  We keep a small flock of chickens, grow food to supplement our summer meals, and tons of cut flowers in my new cutting garden I call Backyard Blossoms.This is my first year as a local flower farmer.

Our farm has a rich history--it was established in 1896 and was owned by the same family for over a hundred years (making it a recognized century farm) until the last owners decided it was time to pack up, move to town, and let someone else start their own memories there. And we have begun doing just that.\r\n\r\nLast spring we brought our horses home from boarding; they are now housed in a shed that at one point was used for sheep. (Hopefully in our 1920\'s dairy barn, when we have the time to renovate it!)

I have a distinctly simple and rustic taste which translates well into minimalist, clean cut aprons fit for any man or woman. I live to create and am so lucky that this is my full time job. Everything in our shop is dreamed up, cut out, and sewn by my own two hands (with the help of my sewing machine of course).  I take great pleasure in thinking of my aprons adorning kitchens around the world. From Boston to Ontario to England to Australia, my aprons are well traveled! \r\n\r\nWhen I am not sewing, I am taking care of our animals, taking various laundry items back from Pete, working on our 100+ year old house,  making feeble attempts at gardening (better luck next year!), cooking, knitting, or riding my horse Gunner.

I feel it is important to preserve the past handcrafts by educating the public about the history and process of traditional rughooking.

I also still enjoy knitting, am learning to spin ìartî yarn on a drop spindle, and look forward to learning how to weave.  I always seem to have a hook or needle in my hand wherever I go.

We tried a number of different types and found that all of them wasted significant amounts of feedÖsometimes up to 25%...because the hens tend to ìbill outî the food. We also realized that the feeders did not dispense the feed very efficiently and that we needed to refill them more frequently than we thought necessary.\r\n\r\nSo we set about designing and building The Ultimate Fowl Feeder (TUFF). The TUFF feeder is gravity-fed and constructed of rust-proof, 20 gauge steel with aluminum rivets. It holds 25 pounds of layer mash and because the base of the feeder is angled toward the openings the feed slides down and smoothly dispenses until empty. The feeder openings are large enough for the hens to get their beaks in, but not bill out. Effectively this means less frequent refilling and almost no feed waste. \r\n', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', null, '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', null, null, null, null, null, null, '2012-10-08 22:08:22', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', null, 'https://www.facebook.com/BackyardChick?ref=hl#!/BackyardChick?fref=ts', '', '', '', 'http://ruminski.wordpress.com/', 'backyardchick', '', null, '1'), ('501', '59', 'Sage and Sea Farms', 'Deb Counts', 'Tabor', 'sageandseafarms@gmail.com', 'sageandseafarms@gmail.com', '', '', 'PORTLAND', 'Oregon', '', 'United States', '0', '0', 'Our drinking vinegars are made with distilled white vinegar, cane sugar, and fruit.

My three younger sisters and I played in the pastures behind our home, wore feed sack sundresses, and ran everywhere bare footed. I remember pretending to ìcan vegetablesî in old discarded jars.   Persimmon leaves and grass were our pretend veggies.   I pulled cotton and went to a one-room country school house.   I really did walk one quarter of a mile to catch the school bus until we moved closer to my school.\r\nï	The best part of my life came later when I met the man of my dreams. I became a true farm girl when I married a ìfarm boyî forty-five years ago. After he graduated from college he became an agriculture instructor and we purchased a small acreage in the community where he taught. A few years later we bought a couple more farms.

When you grow your own seed, you don\'t have to rely on anyone to provide something that you can provide yourself, your family and your loved ones. \r\nLet\'s start a revolution !\r\nseed saving how-to and nutritional facts on the inside of every pack.\r\n\r\nSeeing the potential damage from genetically altered seeds, and headlines like... \"Industry Aims to Strip Local Control of Food Supply\" helped us decide to take responsibility for our own food source; and to help others take responsibility for theirs. Our ability to \'grow our own\' is in jeopardy, and we\'ve got to get ourselves back to the garden. The more people know about how to grow their own food and save seed, the better. We are happy to announce that we are offering heirloom vegetable seeds of several types. Nutritional information and seed saving instructions come with all vegetable seeds that we sell. We abide strictly to the Safe Seed pledge, returning to the earth with seed from an earlier time, before corporations took advantage and control over our food sources. Our standards are strict regarding the seeds we sell.\r\nWe aim towards assuring the future of our food source.  Nutritional information and seed saving instructions included.I have saved seeds for the last 20 years. I can certainly teach others how to do it too. Since I didn\'t want to waste my time on nutrient-low foods, I looked up the healthiest foods and found this site, whfoods.com; it taught me where my energy should be spent in my own garden. Saving seeds is easier than you might think ! There were so many seeds when I harvested, I couldn\'t possibly use them all, so I thought I would sell them, and teach people about the nutrition each variety holds. I designed the seed packet to have all the information needed to save seed and a little nutritional information to nourish the mind.\r\n\r\nHeirloom seeds come from non-hybrid (open-pollinated) varieties of vegetables. Growers can save their own seeds from heirloom seeds, as opposed to most modern hybrids which produce sterile or unreliable seeds. The term heirloom is used because the seeds for many of these varieties were saved by hand for generations. Farmers of the past dedicated their entire lives to producing seeds for plants that would grow well in their local area, only to have them go extinct due to commercial interests. On average, food travels over 1,000 miles to get to your plate. 70 to 90% of the food in any store is *GMO ! It\'s time to turn this around and get local. The more I learned, the more I knew this was the path for me.\r\n\r\nChemical companies like Monsanto are part of the pesticide industry and they have been aggressively buying up seed companies for more than 20 years. I now refuse to rely on anyone for my seed... I didn\'t know if the seed I bought was genetically modified, or hybridized past the point of healthy. I question what they have done. I know their priority, and it\'s not health, either yours or mine. Large corporations aided and abetted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have lowered organic standards. We will not stoop that low. Seeds are treasures and seed diversification is essential if we are to withstand food viruses such as the one that caused the Great Potato Famine in Ireland in the 1840s. With proper storage, most seed can last indefinitely. We need to take back responsibility for our food source and our health. Fortunately, this is neither difficult nor time consuming.\r\nTogether we will take back control over nutritional integrity. It can\'t get more local than when you grow your own - from your seed. No more worries about the food grown for the masses being tainted because when you grow your own, that concern is remedied. The fresher your food source, the more nutritious it is. When you grow with your own seed, you and your family don\'t have to rely on anyone to provide something that you can provide yourself.\r\n\r\nWhat seed we don\'t grow here in Lewis County, New York, we buy or trade\r\nwith other small family organic farms. This is common practice with smaller seed growers. Pesticides, fungicides and chemical fertilizers annihilate soil. The food grown in these conditions isn\'t healthy. If the minerals aren\'t in the soil, they won\'t be in your food. We believe heirloom seeds go hand in hand with organic gardening and organic farming. The more people know about how to grow their own food and save seed, the better. Nutritional information and seed saving how-to come with all vegetable seeds that we sell. Our goal is to offer the best varieties for you to begin your own seed saving adventure.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to save the seeds from individual plants that meet your standards. We adhere strictly to the Safe Seed pledge, returning to the earth with seed from an earlier time, before corporations took control over and advantage of our food sources.\r\n\r\nOmmas-Aarden Heirloom seed.\r\nWe must work together to assure the future of our food source.\r\nRemember -nutritional information and seed saving instructions comes with all vegetable seeds.\r\n\r\n*Genetically Modified (GMO) seeds are patented and require a license fee and a contract to use certain pesticides.

Each aluminum sign is fully waterproof and UV resistantóthink street sign sturdy!', 'Our family (husband, two kids, dog, etc.) moved to an old farmhouse in historic Eagledale, Bainbridge Island. The home was built in 1896 and restored in 1990. It sits on 2 1/2 acres and includes a very large fenced vegetable/flower garden, beautiful pond and many fruit trees. The fruit includes 5 different apples, Italian plum and pear. Last year we got really into canning and we made apple butter, rhubarb jam, pickles, pickled green beans, and tomatillo salsa. \r\n\r\nAt this point our mini-farm is just for fun - we love to share our fruit and vegetables with friends. I do sell our eggs to help pay for the organic feed. My husband built the coop because there was a perfect spot to have chickens. They have a large covered protected area (raccoons and coyotes are frequent visitors) and we absolutely love having them. I feed them all organic feed and during the summer they get lots of kale and swiss chard from the garden which makes their yolks a deep orange. \r\n\r\nOur pond has a blue heron, many different kinds of birds (hooded mergansers, widgeons, and sometimes wood ducks). The frogs are extremely loud at night but put us right to sleep.\r\n\r\nI also do Fine Art and have had a few exhibits at local galleries here on Bainbridge Island. I would say that my love for art, design and now our mini-farm morphed into this fun and creative business, Bainbridge Farm Goods. I love when people ask for specific signs that suit their particular interests. It started as chicken coop and vegetable garden signs and now we have goats, horses, bees, etc. \r\n\r\nThe BEST part about Bainbridge Farm Goods are my customers. They are the nicest people! I think it\'s because most of them are living a balanced life and they either have vegetable gardens, farm animals or just like happy signs. \r\n', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', null, '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', null, null, null, null, null, null, '2012-11-30 20:04:51', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', null, 'http://Bainbridge Farm Goods', '', '', '', '', 'bainbridgefarmgoods', '', null, '1'), ('539', '185', 'By Stephanie Smith', 'Stephanie', 'Smith', 'bystephaniesmith@gmail.com', 'caseysmith211@gmail.com', '1732 S Crescent Ave', '', 'Independence', 'Missouri', '64052', 'United States', '0', '0', 'Our family lives on a little backyard farm.

My name is Sherry Hughes and I\'m coming to you from the great state of Arkansas!  The rural lifestyle has been a mainstay for most of my life allowing for a couple of stints in \"town\" living.  Seems like anytime I found myself living in town, dreams of returning to the country were close behind.\r\n\r\nMy husband and I have found ourselves raising at different times, cows, goats (meat and dairy), chickens, turkeys, pigs, dogs, cats, vegetables, fruits, children and grandchildren(although the grandchildren get loved on, then go home)!  We aren\'t raising quite as many things at this point, but we are still hatching turkeys and chickens and growing a garden.  The children are grown and we now have seven grandchildren.\r\n\r\nArt in many forms, whether using paint, paper and pencils or embroidery floss and a needle has been a constant in my life since childhood.  Soap has also become a major influence in my life.  Soap?  Yes, soap.  After learning to make it several years ago and falling in love with the benefits to my skin, I felt I had to share it with others.  Many folks have told me of how it has improved their lives.  Many skin problems are now gone and I know personally my need for skin lotion has diminished dramatically!\r\n\r\nNow, with my husband\'s blessing, I\'m focusing and devoting much more of my time to pursuing this long-time dream of living an artful life with the art of soap making thrown in for good measure!.\r\n\r\n', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', null, null, null, null, null, null, '2013-05-30 07:31:33', '2013-09-29 12:41:36', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'https://www.facebook.com/LaughingMooseDesign', '', '', '', '', 'laughingmoosedesign', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'), ('555', '381', 'Neuenschwander Homestead', 'Terrance', 'Meyer', 'terrance.m.meyer@gmail.com', 'terrance.m.meyer@gmail.com', '22711 NE Laughlin Rd', '', 'Gaston ', 'Oregon', '97118', 'United States', '0', '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', null, '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', null, null, null, null, null, null, '2013-07-09 03:04:07', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', '', '', 'neuenschwander-homestead', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'), ('561', '404', 'Test Shop for Cindy', 'Cindy', 'Tester', 'nine13@eastonworks.com', 'cindy@tester.com', '3100 NE Jackson School Rd.', '', 'Hillsboro', 'Oregon', '97124', 'United States', '0', '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', null, '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', null, null, null, null, null, null, '2013-10-08 12:22:20', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', '', '', 'test-shop-for-cindy', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '1'), ('562', '500', 'Sam\'s Shop', 'Sam', 'Subscribe', 'sam@subscribe.com', 'sam@subscribe.com', '1234 Anywhere St.', '', 'Pudunksville', 'WA', '98123', 'US', '0', '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', null, '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'GWLZ64Z6XE5DY', null, 'I-7F5737F395SB', 'Active', '2013-10-22 07:00:00', 'US', '2013-11-02 17:43:41', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', '', '', 'sams-shop', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0'), ('563', '501', 'Test Shop', 'Lester', 'Tester', 'sam@subscribe.com', 'sam@subscribe.com', '1234 Anywhere St.', '', 'Pudunksville', 'WA', '98123', 'US', '0', '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', null, '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'GWLZ64Z6XE5DY', 'sam@subscribe.com', 'I-0AXKDX6TY5MH', 'Active', '2013-12-24 00:00:00', 'US', '2013-11-05 18:57:36', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', '', '', 'test-shop', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0'), ('601', '525', 'Lester\'s Farm', 'Lester', 'Tester', 'pete@seaquest.com', 'lester2@tester.com', '2010 S.W.
